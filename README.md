# Battery-remaining-displayed-on-the-display-using-Max17048-lipoly-module-with-STM32
This project involves the displaying of the Battery % on 0.91 inch oled display the the calculationes done by max17048 li poly module functions.

STM32 library for working with OLEDs based on SSD1306, supports I2C and 4-wire SPI.
It also works with SH1106, SH1107 and SSD1309 which are compatible with SSD1306.

This code will work for these mentioned family of STM32 by making the required changes.
